## From Reverse Polish to Infix
The following is an example of an expression written in reverse polish notation:
1 3 + 2 4 2 ∗ + ∗ (1)
It’s a postfix notation, and is computer friendly when it comes to calculating the answer.
However, this notation is hard to read for the human eye. Implement a java-program
rpTranslator which takes an arbitrary reverse polish expression and converts it to a fully
bracketed expression in infix notation. In this case, the output would be:
((1 + 3) ∗ (2 + (4 ∗ 2))) (2)
You may assume that the input is a sequence of strings separated by whitespaces. Strings
”*” and ”+” represent the operators.


## Timeline
A popular feature of every well known web browser is the ability to navigate back and forth
through the last websites visited. This timeline is often a single track, so if you go back a
couple of websites and decide to go to a new website from there, you erase ”the future”.
Implement a java-program siteBrowser which takes a number N, and then N lines. The
lines contain either a website title (a string) or a command ∗back∗ or ∗forward∗ to indicate that the user hits backward or forward respectively. For each line, print out the current
title of the website. If the user wants to go past the first or last website in the timeline, the
program should print a warning and stay at the current website.
This is an example of an input and its corresponding output:

## Triplicates in four lists
Given four lists of N names, devise a linearithmic (O(N*log(N))) algorithm to determine
if there is any name which occurs in exact three of the four lists. If so, return the lexicographically first such name. Implement your algorithm in Java (exactTriplicates) and
do a (theoretical) runtime analysis that explains how you arrive at the linearithmic order
of growth


## When is sorting profitable?
An easy way to find the position of an element in an array is to just loop through the array
until you find the element, or conclude that the element does not occur. This method is
fast for a few searches, but when the number of searches increase you might want to sort
the array first, and then use binary search to find the element you’re looking for.
In this exercise we want to know for how many searches O(N*log(N)) sorting becomes
profitable. Use an array of size N = 10e6 of random integers and compare linear searches
in the unsorted array against binary searches in the sorted array. If the search is successful,
the position of the element in the array should be printed. You can use the binary search
algorithm provided in the algs4 library. When evaluating binary search, take the total time
of all searches plus the time it takes to sort the array. Test first for S = 5, 10, 20, 40,...
random searches, until linear search becomes slower than binary search. You will find an S
for which linear search is fastest, such that for 2S binary search is fastest. Then interpolate
between S and 2S to find some break-even point.
Answer these questions:
1. Based on your experiments, what is the break-even S?
2. If you run the experiment multip
